# Wallpapers

This is a set of images I use as desktop wallpapers; Most of the newer images in the collection are from Unsplash, but there's a lot that are from various other sources which have just been collected over the years. I use the "In Rotation" folder for the images that I have rotating as my desktop background all the time. The "Out of Rotation" are mostly the older images which I just don't feel like using anymore, but haven't deleted for some reason.
